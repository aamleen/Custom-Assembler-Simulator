## Introduction

The Custom Assembler and Simulator project is a powerful tool designed to assist developers in working with assembly language programs. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the machine code instructions executed by a computer's processor. It provides a human-readable representation of the instructions and allows programmers to directly control the hardware components of a system. 

An **assembler** is a crucial component in the development process of assembly language programs. It is responsible for translating human-readable assembly code into machine code, which consists of binary instructions that can be executed directly by the hardware. The assembler analyzes the assembly code, performs syntax and semantic checks, resolves labels and addresses, and generates the corresponding machine code.

On the other hand, a **simulator** is a software tool that emulates the behavior of a computer system. It allows programmers to execute and test their assembly language programs without the need for physical hardware. The simulator interprets the machine code instructions generated by the assembler and executes them step-by-step, emulating the behavior of a real processor. It updates the values of registers, memory locations, and other system components according to the executed instructions.

## Features

- **Custom Assembler:**
  - Converts human-readable assembly code into machine code/binary based on a specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
  - Implements a uniquely designed ISA that supports various assembly instructions, including mathematical and logical operations, flags, equality checks, and branch statements.
  - Performs thorough error detection and provides meaningful suggestions to help programmers identify and fix potential issues in their assembly code.
  - Supports the use of labels and addresses to refer to memory locations.

- **Custom Simulator:**
  - Simulates the execution of machine code generated by the custom assembler.
  - Emulates the behavior of a processor by performing mathematical and logical operations specified by the instructions.
  - Updates the values of registers, memory locations, and other system components in accordance with the executed instructions.

- **Memory Access Trace Analysis:**
  - Analyzes memory access patterns during simulation for efficiency evaluation.
  - Provides insights into memory access patterns, allowing programmers to identify potential optimizations.

## Automated Testing

To ensure the correctness and robustness of the Custom Assembler and Simulator, a comprehensive suite of automated tests is provided. These tests cover various aspects of the assembler and simulator functionalities. To run the automated tests, navigate to the `automatedTesting` directory and execute the `run` file. You can pass additional options as arguments to customize the testing process:

- `--verbose`: Enables verbose output, providing detailed information about the test execution.
- `--no-asm`: Skips the evaluation of the custom assembler.
- `--no-sim`: Skips the evaluation of the custom simulator.

Running these automated tests helps to validate the accuracy and reliability of both the custom assembler and simulator components of the project. It also ensures that the project is able to handle various edge cases and error scenarios. The automated tests are designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to add new tests to cover additional functionalities and edge cases.
